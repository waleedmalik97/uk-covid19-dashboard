# Interactive Dashboard for UK Covid-19 Statistics built with Plotly Dash
In this project, I've developed a dashboard using python libraries Plotly Dash which represents the overall situation of Covid-19 in the UK. This dashboard consists of
1. Global comparisons of deaths and cases due to Covid-19.
2. Headlines regarding Covid-19, scraped from BBC news.
3. Pie Charts showing Vaccination progress in the UK.
4. Heatmaps and Bar charts for the deaths and cases due to Covid-19 with respect to the UK's regions.
5. Bar chart for max and min transmission rate of coronavirus over the year.
6. Daily hospitalization capacity of Covid-19 Patients in the UK.
7. Bar chart representing the number of Mechanical Ventilation beds occupied by Covid-19 patients.
8. Scatter plot showing the daily diagnosed Covid-19 patient with respect to their age bands.
9. Mapbox API for geographically displaying the overall impact of Covid-19 in the UK regions.

This dashboard represents the visualizations of the UK's Covid-19 data which are coming through the APIs which can be accessed from the UK's national Covid-19 repository. This dashboard also consists of a daily news feature that shows the headlines that are being scraped from the BBC news website.
